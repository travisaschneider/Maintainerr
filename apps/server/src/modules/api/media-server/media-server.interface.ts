 *
 * Design notes:
 * - All async methods should handle errors gracefully and log appropriately
 * - Cache management is implementation-specific but exposed via resetMetadataCache
 *
 * Error handling contract:
 * - Read operations (get*, search*): Return empty array/undefined on failure, log the error
 * - Write operations (create*, update*, delete*, add*, remove*): Throw Error with descriptive message
 * - This allows callers to safely iterate over read results while catching write failures
